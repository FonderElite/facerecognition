# What is facial-recognition?
> A facial recognition system is a technology capable of matching a human face from a digital image or a video frame against a database of faces, typically employed to authenticate users through ID verification services, works by pinpointing and measuring facial features from a given image. 

# Installation
```git clone https://github.com/FonderElite/facerecognition
   pip3 install requirements.txt
```

# How to run?
```
 python3 facerec.py
```
# Possible Bugs
> You might want to change the **faceCascade,mouthCascade and the eyeCascade**
to the directory which the cascade files are placed.
Consider also changing the **car_Cascade's** xml file location for the car recognition to work.
### Example: ```faceCascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier('file_location')```
